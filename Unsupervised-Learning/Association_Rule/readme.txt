# Breast Cancer Detection using XGBoost

## Project Overview
This machine learning project implements a breast cancer detection system using the XGBoost algorithm to classify breast cancer cases as benign or malignant. The model achieves high accuracy in predicting cancer diagnoses based on cellular characteristics.

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.x
- Key Libraries:
  - XGBoost (v2.1.2): Core classification algorithm
  - scikit-learn (v1.5.1): For model evaluation and data splitting
  - Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
  - NumPy: Numerical computations
  - Matplotlib: Visualization
  
## Dataset
The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset containing cellular features:
- Features include measurements of cell characteristics
- Binary classification: Benign (0) or Malignant (1)
- Dataset is split 80/20 for training and testing
