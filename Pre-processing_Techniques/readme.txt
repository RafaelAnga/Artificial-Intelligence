This directory contains implementations of various dimensionality reduction techniques used in machine learning. These techniques are essential for reducing the complexity of high-dimensional data while preserving important patterns and relationships.

Techniques:
1. Kernel PCA
Purpose: Non-linear extension of PCA that can capture complex, non-linear relationships in data.

Key Features:
  - Uses kernel trick to compute principal components in high-dimensional space
  - Can handle non-linear relationships
  - More computationally intensive than regular PCA
  - Various kernel options (RBF, polynomial, sigmoid)

Use Cases:
  - Non-linear feature extraction
  - Complex pattern recognition
  - Image denoising
  - Face recognition
  - Biological data analysis

2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
Purpose: Supervised dimensionality reduction technique that maximizes class separability.

Key Features:
  - Supervised learning method
  - Focuses on maximizing class separation
  - Can be used for both dimension reduction and classification
  - Assumes normal distribution of data

Use Cases:
  - Face recognition
  - Medical diagnosis
  - Customer classification
  - Speech recognition
  - Marketing analytics


3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Purpose: Linear dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a new coordinate system.

Key Features:
  - Unsupervised learning method
  - Preserves maximum variance in the data
  - Creates uncorrelated features
  - Linear transformation only

Use Cases:
  - Image compression
  - Feature extraction
  - Data visualization
  - Noise reduction
  - Pattern recognition


** Implementation Guidelines
Data Preparation:
  - Remove missing values
  - Scale features
  - Handle categorical variables

Technique Selection:
  - Use PCA for linear relationships and general dimensionality reduction
  - Use Kernel PCA when data has non-linear patterns
  - Use LDA when class separation is important and you have labeled data

Parameter Tuning:
  - Number of components
  - Kernel selection (for Kernel PCA)
  - Explained variance ratio threshold

** Best Practices
Before Application:
  - Always scale your data
  - Check for missing values
  - Visualize data distribution

During Application:
  - Cross-validate results
  - Monitor explained variance ratio
  - Check for overfitting

After Application:
  - Validate results with domain knowledge
  - Compare performance with original features
  - Document transformation parameters

Common Pitfalls to Avoid
  Kernel PCA:
    * Poor kernel selection
    * Computational overhead with large datasets
    * Difficulty in interpreting transformed features

  LDA:
    * Using with highly imbalanced classes
    * Applying to non-normally distributed data
    * Using when number of samples per class is too small

  PCA:
    * Assuming linearity when relationships are non-linear
    * Not scaling features before application
    * Keeping too many/few components
